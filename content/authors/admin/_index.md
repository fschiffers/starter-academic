Florian graduated 2017 from [FAU Erlangen](https://www.fau.eu/) in Germany where he received a M.Sc. in [Physics](https://www.physics.nat.fau.eu/)  and a M.Sc.Hons in [Advanced Optical Technologies](https://www.maot.studium.fau.de/) . He wrote his thesis on Computed Tomography in Talbot-Lau X-ray Phase-Contrast Imaging under the joint supervision of [Prof. Gisela Anton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisela_Anton), [Dr-Ing Christian Riess](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0HGXYNMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Andreas Maier](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MA6SDuEAAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to this Florian was conducting research in the field of optical 3D sensing in the group of [Prof. Gerd Häusler](https://www.youtube.com/user/Osmin3D) (2012-2015). Later, he worked at [Siemens Healthineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Healthineers) on a pre-development project in robotics for image-guided surgery. After graduation he spent six months at the [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in China with the Department of Biomedical Engineering lead by [Prof. Qiushi Ren](https://bme.pku.edu.cn/) working on machine learning applications in Ophthalmology.

At [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) Florian is working on algorithm development for inverse problems. He is especially interested on how to enhance conventional techniques, e.g. reconstruction based on physical models, by exploiting the power of data-driven machine learning.  His current projects include imaging through scattering media, extended depth-of-field imaging, tomographic problems with different modalities as well as topographic imaging.
